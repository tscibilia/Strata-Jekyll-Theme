Our story is not one of great unique quality, the distinctiveness, lies within its exceptional brothers. We were founded in 1991, at Pratt Institute in New York, by six gentlemen who sought to establish an organization that would counter stereotypes, promote a moral code (not common to fraternities), and stress academics above all else. 

We exist by five principles: Academics, Charity, Respect, Love, and Social Development, which is the foundation from which this organization was formed and continues to be the guiding aspect in all pursuits of the Fraternity.
