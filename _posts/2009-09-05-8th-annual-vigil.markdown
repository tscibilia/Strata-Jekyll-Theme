Every year since 2002, the active brothers of the Pi Sigma Chi Fraternity dedicate one candle to each person who suffered the unfortunate tragedy of September 11th. A day that will be remembered forever, and a day Pi Sigma Chi will help students and faculty not to forget. 

This September 11th join us on the new Grand Ave Walkway next to the main lawn on Friday the 11th at 8pm with all the students and faculty who wish to mourn, join, socialize or watch as we dedicate another year to the attack on the World Trade Center and its victims.
