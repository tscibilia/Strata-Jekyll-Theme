Pi Sigma Chi seeks to devote much of our time and energy toward promoting good will charities and well as fundraisers in order to provide our communities with excitement, prosperity, and hope. Both active brothers as well as the alumni chapter seek to provide either their time or their services to helping the community through our charitable events. Please look for our links describing each of our events in a little more detail.
